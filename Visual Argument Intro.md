Visual Argument Intro  
Sam Strader

	I wanted to do a visual argument about something I would use in the future, and because I have done some work with Charlotte FC over the summer, I decided to do an ad about the professional soccer team that can be used in the context of a digital ad online like on a website, or on a billboard. This shows the passion that American fans can have and how much fun a game can be because people look down on the league in the United States because the games and the fans aren’t as passionate as European fans. However, I was able to have a strong background photo of a packed group, along with another photo of a group of fans close up, and I used the eraser tool to just show a close up of the fans with the crowd to show the passion of American fans. I used a bold text to highlight “American Passion” and for people to buy tickets. I wanted people who see this ad to be able to see the vision of the ad without having to look at a lot of information and to see the passion itself by highlighting the crowds and the fans and staying away from a lot of text.
